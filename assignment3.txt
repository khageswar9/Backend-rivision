Q-1) . What is a DeadLock ? And what are methods by which we can handle deadLock.

//Answer
//Deadlock Explanation
1. In Multi-programming environment, we have several processes competing for finite number of resources
2. Process requests a resource (R), if R is not available (taken by other process), process enters in a waiting state. Sometimes that waiting process is never able to change its state because the resource, it has requested is busy (forever, called DEADLOCK (DL)
3. Two or more processes are waiting on some resourceâ€™s availability, which will never be available as it is also busy with some other process. The Processes are said to be in Deadlock.
4. DL is a bug present in the process/thread synchronization method.
5. In DL, processes never finish executing, and the system resources are tied up, preventing other jobs from starting.
6. Example of resources: Memory space, CPU cycles, files, locks, sockets, IO devices etc.
7. Single resource can have multiple instances of that. E.g., CPU is a resource, and a system can have 2 CPUs.

//handling Deadlock
 Recovery from Deadlock
    a. Process termination
        i. Abort all DL processes
        ii. Abort one process at a time until DL cycle is eliminated.
    b. Resource preemption
        i. To eliminate DL, we successively preempt some resources from processes and
        give these resources to other processes until DL cycle is broken

Q-2) What is a HTTP protocol? Difference between HTTP and HTTPS.

//Answer
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to load web pages using hypertext links. HTTP is an application layer protocol designed to transfer information between networked devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack. A typical flow over HTTP involves a client machine making a request to a server, which then sends a response message.

//difference between HTTP and HTTPS

    *) HTTP URL in your browser's address bar is http://, and the HTTPS URL is https://.
    *) HTTP is unsecured while HTTPS is secured.
    *) HTTP sends data over port 80 while HTTPS uses port 443.
    *) HTTP operates at application layer, while HTTPS operates at transport layer.
    *) No SSL certificates are required for HTTP; with HTTPS, it is required that you have an SSL certificate and a CA & sign it
    *) HTTP doesn't require domain validation, whereas HTTPS requires at least domain validation and certain certificates even require legal document validation.
    *) There is no encryption in HTTP; with HTTPS, the data is encrypted before sending.

Q-3) What is IPv4 and IPv6 ? 
    // Answer 
    The Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is a protocol for use on packet-switched Link Layer networks (e.g. Ethernet).
    IPv4 provides an addressing capability of approximately 4.3 billion addresses.
    The Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is more advanced and has better features compared to IPv4.  
    It has the capability to provide an infinite number of addresses.  
    It is replacing IPv4 to accommodate the growing number of networks worldwide and help solve the IP address exhaustion problem.One of the differences between IPv4 and IPv6 is the appearance of the IP addresses.  
    IPv4 uses four 1 byte decimal numbers, separated by a dot (i.e. 192.168.1.1), while IPv6 uses hexadecimal numbers that are separated by colons (i.e. fe80::d4a8:6435:d2d8:d9f3b11).

Q-4) What is DNS ? 
    // Answer 
    The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. 
    Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. 
    Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. 
    DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.
